Superstore Sales Analysis with Generative AI
Comprehensive data analysis of the Global Superstore dataset using Python, Pandas, and Plotly, with assistance from generative AI for streamlined workflow, code debugging, and insights generation. Explores sales trends, profitability, and operational costs through interactive visualizations.
This project performs a comprehensive sales analysis on the Global Superstore dataset, leveraging the power of generative AI to assist in the data analysis process. The analysis covers various aspects of sales performance, including sales by category, monthly sales trends, monthly sales by category, profit vs sales by subcategory, and shipping cost analysis.

Key Features:

- Data Loading and Preview: Efficiently loads the dataset from a remote URL and provides a preview of the data structure 

- Sales Analysis by Category: Visualizes total sales for different product categories to identify top-performing areas.

- Monthly Sales Analysis: Analyzes sales trends over time to identify seasonality and growth patterns.

- Monthly Sales Over Time by Category: Provides a detailed view of monthly sales performance for each product category.

- Profit vs Sales by Subcategory: Explores the relationship between profit and sales at a subcategory level to identify profitable products.

- Shipping Cost Analysis: Visualizes shipping costs across different ship modes to understand expense distribution.

- Generative AI Assistance: Utilized generative AI (like Google Colab's AI features) to assist in code generation, error debugging, and explaining code, significantly accelerating the analysis workflow.
